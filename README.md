# CS-425: Databases Project (Best Buy Inventory)

## Project Description
This project involves designing and implementing a database schema for a given application domain, followed by developing an application that interacts with the database. The project is a group task, with each group consisting of three students. The class will collectively choose a topic by 09/11. The project is divided into three main tasks:

1. **Design an ER Database Model**
2. **Implement an SQL Script to Create the Database**
3. **Implement the Application**

## Tasks

### 1. Design an ER Database Model
- **Objective**: Analyze the requirements of the application domain and design an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to model the domain.
- **Deliverables**: ER diagram that includes entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

### 2. Implement an SQL Script to Create the Database
- **Objective**: Use the techniques taught in class to derive a relational schema from the ER model and implement an SQL script that creates this schema in PostgreSQL.
- **Deliverables**: SQL script that creates the relational schema, including tables, constraints, and indexes.

### 3. Implement the Application
- **Objective**: Develop an application program that enables a user to store, manipulate, and query the database.
- **Deliverables**: Application source code and documentation. The application should support:
  - Adding, updating, and deleting records.
  - Querying the database with various search criteria.
  - User interface for interacting with the database.
  - This project follows a similar model to "Try Django" from Coding For Enterpreneurs in using Django to implement our application.

## Project Timeline
- **Task 1 Deadline**: [To be decided by the instructor]
- **Task 2 Deadline**: [To be decided by the instructor]
- **Task 3 Deadline**: [To be decided by the instructor]

## Group Organization
- Each group will consist of three students.
- Collaborate effectively to distribute the tasks and ensure each member contributes to the project.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database Management System**: PostgreSQL
- **Programming Languages**: [Specify based on your application, e.g., Python, Java, etc.]
- **Development Tools**: [Specify any tools used for development, e.g., IDEs, SQL clients, etc.]

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit the ER diagram, SQL script, application source code, and documentation as per the deadlines.
- Ensure all files are well-documented and follow the coding standards discussed in class.

## Repository
This repository is dedicated to the CS-425 Databases course project. It includes all the necessary files and documentation for the tasks described above.
